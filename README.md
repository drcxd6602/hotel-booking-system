This repository houses a full stack hotel booking application developed using the MERN (MongoDB, Express.js, React.js, Node.js) stack. The application provides users with a seamless experience to search for hotels, view available rooms, and make bookings.

## Features

- User Authentication: The application incorporates a secure registration and login system for users to create accounts and access personalized features.
- Hotel Search: Users can search for hotels based on location, dates, and specific preferences such as amenities or price range.
- Room Selection: The application displays available rooms with detailed information, including room types, prices, and occupancy details.
- Booking Process: Users can select desired rooms, specify booking details (check-in/check-out dates, guest count), and confirm their reservations.
- User Dashboard: A dedicated user dashboard allows users to view their booking history, manage upcoming reservations, and update their profile information.
- Admin Dashboard: An administrative dashboard is available for authorized personnel to manage hotels, rooms, and bookings efficiently.
- Reviews and Ratings: Users can provide feedback, ratings, and reviews based on their hotel experiences, enabling others to make informed decisions.
- Responsive Design: The application features a responsive layout, ensuring optimal user experience across various devices and screen sizes.

## Technologies Used

- MongoDB: A flexible and scalable NoSQL database used for storing hotel and user-related data.
- Express.js: A fast and minimalist web application framework used to build the server-side components and handle API requests.
- React.js: A popular JavaScript library used for developing interactive and dynamic user interfaces on the client-side.
- Node.js: A JavaScript runtime environment that enables server-side execution and facilitates communication between the front-end and back-end.
